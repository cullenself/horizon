Todo:
Nothing! Currently as good as possible
Need more data and physical view to verify generated horizon
Possible: generate elevation mask from data

+cut data down to verify
+set up easy push/pull from dev to test
+add intermediate status markers
+process data in O(n) rather than O(n^2)
	(could do by reimplementing plotsat to just ingest straight az-el data)
WIP:
+change plotsat to skyview and implement
